# Should bionic limb control mimic the human body?

This repository is still-in-development. It includes the code supporting a study exploring how different robotic prosthetic hand control strategies impact differences in skill learning and neural representations supporting controlling the robotic hand. More details on the study at this stage can be found at https://osf.io/3m592/ where we've provided an informal pre-registration for the study and the primary analyses I will undertake (*written Oct. 2022*).
