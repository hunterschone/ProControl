# Biomimetic versus arbitrary motor control strategies for bionic hand skill learning.

The is code for the Nature Human Behaviour paper will be made available this Friday, March 22, 2024.

The code involves a study exploring how different bionic hand control strategies impact skill learning and neural representations supporting controlling the robotic hand. More details on the study at this stage can be found at https://osf.io/3m592/ where we've provided an informal pre-registration for the study and the primary analyses.
