#Comparing biomimetic and arbitrary motor control strategies when learning to operate a robotic hand

This repository has the code supporting a study exploring how different robotic prosthetic control strategie impact skill learning and neural representations. More details on the study at this stage can be found at https://osf.io/3m592/ where we've provided an informal pre-registration for the study and primary analyses.
